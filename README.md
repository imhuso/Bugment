## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Authentication Failed

- Verify your `AUGMENT_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `AUGMENT_TENANT_URL` are correct
- Ensure the secrets are properly set in your repository settings
- Check that your Augment account has the necessary permissions

#### Review Timeout

- Large diffs may take longer to process
- Consider increasing `max_diff_size` or excluding large files
- Check Augment service status

#### No Comments Posted

- Verify the `github_token` has `pull-requests: write` permission
- Check if the workflow has the correct permissions block
- Ensure the action completed successfully in the workflow logs

### Debug Information

Enable debug logging by setting the `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` secret to `true` in your repository.
